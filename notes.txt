The next selector we're going to look at is the DESCENDANT selector.

DESCENDANT SELECTOR
Select all <a>'s that are nested inside an <li>

li a {
    color: teal;
}

(NB: The absence of a comma means that the anchor tag is 
somewhere nested within or under the li.

If there was a comma, that is:

li, a {
    color: teal;
}

...then that would mean, that we're making all li's and anchor
tags have a teal color.
